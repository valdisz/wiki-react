## Levelpath frontend take-home task

### Task

Implement a list of today's Wikipedia "On this day" using data from the Wikipedia API.

### Requirements

- Initially there must be a button. Data is fetched and displayed after the button is clicked.
- Entries should be ordered by their year.
- "Loading" message/UI component must be shown while data is fetched.
- Error modal must be shown when data fetch fails.

### Implementation requirements

- React framework and application state management framework of your choice must be used.
- Provide some basic styling.
- You can use whatever React project boilerplate, tools and libraries you like.
- TypeScript is preferred over JavaScript.
- Application parts must be tested but you don't have to write tests for every single part, write a single one for every type of test. As an example for imaginary Redux project: action creator, reducer, asynchronous function, UI component render, UI component user interactions are different types of tests.
